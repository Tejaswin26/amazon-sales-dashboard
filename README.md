# Amazon Sales Dashboard – Power BI

## 📊 Project Overview
An interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze Amazon sales performance across locations, products, and order statuses.  
The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor KPIs, identify high-performing regions, and explore product-level trends to support data-driven decisions.

The dataset contains sales transactions, product information, delivery status, and sales options.  
It was cleaned, modeled, and transformed in Power BI for analytical use.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Track overall sales, units sold, and seller count  
- Identify top-performing cities and states  
- Analyze daily sales trends  
- Enable product-level drill-down analysis  

## 🛠 Tools Used
